# test for packets >16M which get split across multiple mysql-packets 
#
# all the tests are about handling >16M packets and their packet-ids
# as there is a proxy in between the client's packet-id sequence might
# be different than the servers:
# - client sends a >16M query (2 packets), proxy replaces it by a small
#   query (1 packet), the server will reply with packet-id 1 which has
#   to be mapped to packet-id 2 when it hits the client (see 3.)
# - the same the other way around (see 4.)
#
# 1. generate >16M string 
# 2. send >16M to the backend
#  2.1. return length of the fieldname as result
# 3. send >16M, let proxy replace it with <16M packet
#  3.1. return length
# 4. send <16M, let proxy replcae it with >16M packet
#  4.1. return length
# ... repeat the same with replacing the resultset
#
# implementation detail
# - we use let and eval here to get around some mysqltest limitations
# - it works with .result files which contain all the text
# - we don't want to store all the plain-text of the >16M packets 
#   in the .result files
# - instead we let the proxy process the LENGTH() queries and eval
#   the result to only have a simple queries in the .result files

# get a 16M string
let $overlong = `SELECT LONG_STRING`;
let $length = `SELECT LENGTH($overlong)`;
eval SELECT $length;

# send the >16M query and let it be replace by a smaller query and forward it
let $replaced = `SELECT REPLACE($overlong)`;
let $length = `SELECT LENGTH($replaced)`;
eval SELECT $length;

# send the small query and let it be replace by a >16M query and forward it
let $replaced = `SELECT SMALL_QUERY`;
let $length = `SELECT LENGTH($replaced)`;
eval SELECT $length;

# send the >16M query and through the proxy encoders/decoders
let $bounce = `SELECT $overlong`;
let $length = `SELECT LENGTH($bounce)`;
eval SELECT $length;

# send the >16M query and replace the result on the way back
let $replace = `SELECT RESULT($overlong)`;
eval SELECT $replace;

# send the small query, let it be replaced by a >16M query and replace the result on the way back
let $replace = `SELECT SMALL_RESULT`;
eval SELECT $replace;
